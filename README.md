# Medium-Posts

This repo contains code pertaining to my first Medium post where I dive deep into theory and application of Scikit-Learn regression module based on an artifical house prices example. 

The future posts will focus on:

- Web Scraping using Scrapy and Selenium
- Deployment of ML-powered applications through a microservice arhitecture on AWS
- Leveraging NLP Transformer Pipelines and publicly available datasources to create products that help people find inspiration.
